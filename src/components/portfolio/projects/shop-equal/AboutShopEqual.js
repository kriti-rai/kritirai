            In June 2020, I teamed up with four other developers (Michael Diaz, Valentine Maillard, Kah Yap and Rashan Smith)
            to build a fully functioning web application for Hack for Black Lives Matter hackathon organized by NYC coders.
            Our app is called Shop Equal and it intends to empower the Black community by directing users to Black-owned businesses.
            Most of my contributions were on the front-end side which is bootstrapped using `create-react-app`.
            I am also helping the team with web-scraping to collect as much data as possible on black-owned businesses.
